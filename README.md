# cup-stacking

I used to work at a catering company where we would stack cups for events. <br>
We stacked these cups in pyramids, for however many people were expected to attend. <br>
I wondered what the best way to stack them was, so that I could perfectly fit every cup. <br>
I made this program to fix that problem. <br>

Coding language is C++. <br>
